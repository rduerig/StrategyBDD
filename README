This project is considered as a research project for personal interest and/or 
academic purpose. Its main goal is to provide an evaluation and a turn prediction
for the board game Havannah.

The following libraries are needed:
- JavaBDD (javabdd-1.0b2, available at http://javabdd.sourceforge.net/)

The above mentioned library JavaBDD wraps other bdd libraries such as CUDD
and BuDDy. To be able to use BuDDy for instance, put the BuDDy library file in the
projects root folder and set a system property for the JVM according to its name.

Example:
The BuDDy library is called libbdd.so. In the source code the property "bdd" is
set to "bdd" via "System.setProperty("bdd","bdd")".

Note that JavaBDD contains those *.so files for the wrapped bdd frameworks. 
If you're running a 32-bit machine, everything is fine but to use those bdd
frameworks with 64-bit machines you have to build them by yourself.
If there is no such *.so file given, JavaBDD falls back to a pure java
implementation.
